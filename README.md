This is a mern application that I am developing in order to do a handson for the course that I am learning right now in udemy.

The app will be, as the name suggests, based on ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB primarily and will be hostel on Github as an open repository.

This is just a demo/prototype application and not ready for full fledged use.
